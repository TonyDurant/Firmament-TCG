## Deck Building
When constructing your deck, select a hero and build your deck using only cards that match the elements your hero represents. Additionally, you can include any number of "Salt" (🜔) cards, which are versatile and can be used with any hero. This allows for strategic flexibility while maintaining thematic coherence with your chosen hero’s element.

Example: If your hero represents Air (🜁) and Water (🜄), your deck can only contain cards from these elements along with any number of "Salt" (🜔) cards.
