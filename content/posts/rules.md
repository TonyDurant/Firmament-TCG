# Quick Rules for **Firmament: Divine Forgottenness**

### Objective:
Defeat your opponent's hero by reducing their HP to zero using a combination of strategic attacks, defenses, and summoned warriors.

### Game Setup:
1. **Choose Your Hero:**
   - Each player selects a hero card and places it in the designated hero zone.
   - Each hero starts with 20 HP. Hero has it’s HP written on the card in the bottom left corner.
2. **Create Your Deck:**
   - Each player builds a deck of cards, including Attack, Defense, Warrior, and Grimoire Page cards. Different formats would have different total number of cards, see the Formats section for details.
3. **Shuffle and Draw:**
   - Shuffle your deck and draw an initial hand of 7 cards. Randomly decide who goes first.

### Game Zones:
1. **Hero Zone:** Place your hero card here.
2. **Resource Zone:** Place your resource cards here.
3. **Grimoire Zone:** Place your Grimoire Page* cards here.
4. **Warrior Zone:** Place your Warrior cards here.
5. **Vanguard:** Place where Warriors are nominated to attack, defend. In other words, where warriors fight.
6. **Battlefield:** All Game Zones combined

**NOTE:** Grimoire Page will be introduced later. First Edition does not have the Grimoire Page mechanics. 

### Turn Phases:
1. **Begin Phase:** Deactivate (turn your cards upright) all your permanent cards on the board so that you can use them again this turn unless there is a modifier or an affect preventing from doing so.
   - Draw one card from your deck. Note: a player do not draw a card on turn number one.
   - A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game.
3. **Main Phase:**
   - You may play a resource card (as mana or strength) from your hand by placing it in the resource zone. Note: all cards are dual purpose, meaning you can play any card for a resource. Resource value you gain is indicated in the bottom-right corner of a card, written upside-down. Turn the card upside-down, indicating you are using it as a resource and place it in the resource zone.
   - Tap resource cards to gain the indicated amount of resources if needed.
   - Play cards from your hand by paying the required resources. To pay the resource ‘activate’ a resource card, rotating it 90 degrees.
   - Summon warriors, place Grimoire Page cards in the Grimoire zone, use Hero’s ability, etc.
5. **Combat Phase:**
   - Declare attacks with your Warriors and/or Attack cards. You do not target a specific Warrior or Hero. Your opponent decides on blockers, meaning how to defend and/or block.
   - Your opponent can choose to block with their warriors and/or Defense cards
   - Calculate damage and apply it to the involved warriors or heroes.
6. **End Phase:**
   - End your turn by playing a resource if you have not already, summon warriors if you can.
   - All warriors heal
   - If you still have resources to spend, you can use your Hero’s abilities or save the resources for your “Defense Phase”
   - Pass the turn

### Card Types:
1. **Attack Cards:**
   - Use to deal damage to enemy warriors or the opponent's hero.
   - Example: Fireball – Deal 5 damage (4 mana points).
2. **Defense Cards:**
   - Use to protect your hero or warriors from attacks.
   - Example: Arcane Barrier – Block 4 damage (2 mana points).
3. **Warrior Cards:**
   - Summon to the battlefield to attack or defend.
   - Example: Enchanted Elf – 4 Power, 4 Mana Points, "Graceful and deadly."
4. **Grimoire Page Cards:**
   - Place in the Grimoire zone to gain special abilities.
   - Example: Arcane Amplification – If you tap your resource, it produces two times as much of that resource instead (4 mana points).

### Special Abilities:
- **Hero Abilities:** Unique to each hero, usable once per turn.
  - Example: Aric, the Battle Mage – Convert 1 strength points into 2 mana points.
- **Grimoire Page Abilities:** Provide powerful effects when placed in the Grimoire zone.
  - Example: Fountain of Valor – TAP: Add one resource of any kind. If your hero is from Pyrithia Ignis, it generates two resources each of any kind (3 strength points).

### Winning the Game:
- The first player to reduce their opponent's hero HP to zero wins the game.
