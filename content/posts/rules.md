# Quick Rules for **Firmament: Divine Forgottenness**

### Objective:
Defeat your opponent's hero by reducing their HP to zero using a combination of strategic attacks, defenses, and summoned warriors.

### Game Setup:
1. **Choose Your Hero:**
   - Each player selects a hero card and places it in the designated hero zone.
   - Each hero starts with 20 HP. Hero has it’s HP written on the card in the bottom left corner.
2. **Create Your Deck:**
   - Each player builds a deck of cards, including Attack, Defense, Warrior, and Grimoire Page cards. Different formats would have different total number of cards, see the Formats section for details.
3. **Shuffle and Draw:**
   - Shuffle your deck and draw an initial hand of 7 cards. Randomly decide who goes first.

### Game Zones:
1. **Hero Zone:** Place your hero card here.
2. **Resource Zone:** Place your resource cards here.
3. **Grimoire Zone:** Place your Grimoire Page* cards here.
4. **Warrior Zone:** Place your Warrior cards here.
5. **Vanguard:** Place where Warriors are nominated to attack, defend. In other words, where warriors fight.
6. **Battlefield:** All Game Zones combined

**NOTE:** Grimoire Page will be introduced later. First Edition does not have the Grimoire Page mechanics. 

### Turn Phases:
1. **Begin Phase:** Deactivate (turn your cards upright) all your permanent cards on the board so that you can use them again this turn unless there is a modifier or an affect preventing from doing so.
   - Draw one card from your deck. Note: a player do not draw a card on turn number one.
   - A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game.
3. **Main Phase:**
   - You may play a resource card (as mana or strength) from your hand by placing it in the resource zone. Note: all cards are dual purpose, meaning you can play any card for a resource. Resource value you gain is indicated in the bottom-right corner of a card, written upside-down. Turn the card upside-down, indicating you are using it as a resource and place it in the resource zone.
   - Tap resource cards to gain the indicated amount of resources if needed.
   - Play cards from your hand by paying the required resources. To pay the resource ‘activate’ a resource card, rotating it 90 degrees.
   - Summon warriors, place Grimoire Page cards in the Grimoire zone, use Hero’s ability, etc.
5. **Combat Phase:**
   - Declare attacks with your Warriors and/or Attack cards. You do not target a specific Warrior or Hero. Your opponent decides on blockers, meaning how to defend and/or block.
   - Your opponent can choose to block with their warriors and/or Defense cards
   - Calculate damage and apply it to the involved warriors or heroes.
6. **End Phase:**
   - End your turn by playing a resource if you have not already, summon warriors if you can.
   - All warriors heal
   - If you still have resources to spend, you can use your Hero’s abilities or save the resources for your “Defense Phase”
   - Pass the turn

### Card Types:
1. **Attack Cards:**
   - Use to deal damage to enemy warriors or the opponent's hero.
   - Example: Fireball – Deal 5 damage (4 mana points).
2. **Defense Cards:**
   - Use to protect your hero or warriors from attacks.
   - Example: Arcane Barrier – Block 4 damage (2 mana points).
3. **Warrior Cards:**
   - Summon to the battlefield to attack or defend.
   - Example: Enchanted Elf – 4 Power, 4 Mana Points, "Graceful and deadly."
4. **Grimoire Page Cards:**
   - Place in the Grimoire zone to gain special abilities.
   - Example: Arcane Amplification – If you tap your resource, it produces two times as much of that resource instead (4 mana points).

### Special Abilities:
- **Hero Abilities:** Unique to each hero, usable once per turn.
  - Example: Aric, the Battle Mage – Convert 1 strength points into 2 mana points.
- **Grimoire Page Abilities:** Provide powerful effects when placed in the Grimoire zone.
  - Example: Fountain of Valor – TAP: Add one resource of any kind. If your hero is from Pyrithia Ignis, it generates two resources each of any kind (3 strength points).

### Winning the Game:
- The first player to reduce their opponent's hero HP to zero wins the game.

### Combat Phase:

#### Combat Sequence 

1. **Declare Attackers:**
    - The attacking player declares which warriors will attack by tapping (turning sideways) the chosen warriors.
    - Attack cards are played directly by the attacking player, representing the hero’s attacks, not the warriors'.
2. **Play Attack Cards:**
    - The attacking player can play attack cards from their hand, applying their effects directly.
    - Attack cards must follow the resource cost requirements and any specific conditions stated on the card.
3. **Declare Defenders:**
    - The defending player declares which warriors will block the incoming attacks. Defending warriors are not tapped.
    - Each attacking warrior can be blocked by any number of defending warriors that are available to defend (i.e., not tapped).
4. **Play Defense Cards:**
    - The defending player can play defense cards from their hand, applying their effects directly.
    - Defense cards must follow the resource cost requirements and any specific conditions stated on the card.
5. **Resolve Combat:**
    - Compare the power of the attacking warriors with the power of the blocking warriors.
    - If an attacking warrior is blocked by multiple defending warriors:
        - The attacking player decides the order in which the defending warriors will block the attacking warrior.
        - The attacking warrior deals its damage to the first blocking warrior in the specified order. If the first blocking warrior is destroyed, any remaining damage is dealt to the next blocking warrior, and so on.
        - Calculate the damage dealt to each blocking warrior based on the attacking warrior's power.
        - If the blocking warrior’s power is higher than the attacking warrior’s power, the attacking warrior is destroyed and sent to the discard pile.
        - If the attacking warrior’s power is higher than a blocking warrior’s power, that blocking warrior is destroyed and sent to the discard pile. The process continues with the next blocking warrior.
        - If both warriors have equal power, both are destroyed and sent to the discard pile.
    - If an attacking warrior is not blocked, it deals damage directly to the defending player or hero.
6. **Damage Resolution:**
    - Apply any additional effects from attack and defense cards that were played during the combat.
    - Resolve any damage spillover to the defending player or hero as per the card effects and rules.
7. **End of Combat:**
    - After resolving all attacks and defenses, discard any used attack and defense cards to the discard pile.

#### Blocking Damage

In the game, defense cards such as a "block X damage" cards are used to reduce the amount of damage an attacking warrior deals to hero. Warrior cards block incoming attacks, no damage spills over to the hero unless specified by a card ability. Understanding how blocking mechanics work is essential for strategic gameplay.

##### Blocking Mechanics:

1. **Blocking with Insufficient Block Value:**
    - **Scenario:** A 3 power warrior attacks you, and you block with a "block 2 damage" card.
    - **Outcome:** The "block 2 damage" card absorbs 2 points of damage from the attacking warrior.
        - **Result:** The remaining 1 point of damage spills over onto the hero.
    - **Example:**
        - **Attack Power:** 3
        - **Block Power:** 2
        - **Damage to Hero:** 3 (attack) - 2 (block) = 1 damage spills over to the hero.
        - **Block Value Equal or Higher than Attack:** If the block value is equal to or higher than the attack power, no damage spills over to the hero.
1. **Blocking with Sufficient Block Value:**
    - **Scenario:** A 3 power warrior attacks you, and you block with a "block 4 damage" card.
    - **Outcome:** The "block 4 damage" card absorbs all 3 points of damage from the attacking warrior.
        - **Result:** No damage spills over onto the hero.
    - **Example:**
        - **Attack Power:** 3
        - **Block Power:** 4
        - **Damage to Hero:** 3 (attack) - 4 (block) = 0 damage spills over to the hero.
        - **Block Value Lower than Attack:** If the block value is lower than the attack power, the difference in damage spills over to the hero.
1. Blocking with Another Warrior:
	- When a warrior blocks an attacking warrior, the damage does not spill over to the hero unless there is a special condition or modifier written on the card.
	- **Example:**
	    - **Scenario:** A 3 power warrior attacks you, and you block with a 2 power warrior.
	    - **Outcome:** The attacking warrior deals 3 damage to the blocking warrior, resulting in the blocking warrior being destroyed and sent to the discard pile. Cards in the discard pile are placed face up.
	    - **Result:** The blocking warrior takes 3 damage and, if its health is less than 3, it is destroyed. No damage spills over to the hero unless specified by a card ability.
	    - **Blocking with Warriors:** When blocking with another warrior, damage does not spill over to the hero unless a card specifies otherwise. If the blocking warrior's power is higher than the attacking warrior's power, the attacking warrior is destroyed. If the warriors have equal power, both warriors are mutually destroyed.

##### Summary:

By using blocking cards effectively, players can reduce incoming damage and protect their hero from attacks. Strategic use of blocking cards based on the attack power they face is crucial for maintaining control over the battlefield and ensuring the hero's survival.
