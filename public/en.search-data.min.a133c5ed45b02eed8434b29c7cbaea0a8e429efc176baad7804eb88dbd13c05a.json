The origins of the Firmament Divide are unknown, adding to the sense of mystery and forgotten history that permeates the world.\nDivine Forgottenness # Divine Forgottenness affects every inhabitant of Firmaterra. Memories and historical records seem to vanish after a few decades, leaving gaps and creating a sense of timelessness. Scholars and sages from all nations have tried to uncover the cause, theorizing that it might be linked to the Firmament Divide or some ancient, divine decree. Despite their efforts, the true nature of this phenomenon remains elusive, shaping the cultural and philosophical outlook of each nation as they strive to preserve what little knowledge they can retain.\nHeroes # Hero Name Nation Reasoning Aric, the Battle Mage Aetheris Ventora Aric’s focus on unity and collaboration aligns with Aetheris Ventora’s philosophy of \u0026ldquo;Unity through Collaboration.\u0026rdquo; Thalia, Forest Guardian Terra Tartarie Thalia’s connection to nature and her role as a guardian fit well with Terra Tartarie’s philosophy of \u0026ldquo;Harmony with Nature.\u0026rdquo; Agnar, the Berserker Pyrithia Ignis Agnar’s strength and warrior spirit align with Pyrithia Ignis’s values of \u0026ldquo;Strength through Conflict.\u0026rdquo; Elara, the Mystic Sage Erynlor Valeria Elara’s wisdom and focus on knowledge match Erynlor Valeria’s emphasis on \u0026ldquo;Continuity\u0026rdquo; and preservation of knowledge.

The Veilkeepers # A secret society trying to conspire and hide the very existence of the Firmament Divide, it would most likely be in Erynlor Valeria. Given their philosophy of continuity, knowledge, preservation, and stability, they would have the resources and motivation to control information and manipulate historical narratives to maintain societal stability.
