Additionally, you can include any number of &amp;ldquo;Salt&amp;rdquo; (üúî) cards, which are versatile and can be used with any hero. This allows for strategic flexibility while maintaining thematic coherence with your chosen hero‚Äôs element.
Example: If your hero represents Air (üúÅ) and Water (üúÑ), your deck can only contain cards from these elements along with any number of &amp;ldquo;Salt&amp;rdquo; (üúî) cards.</description></item><item><title>Lore</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/lore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 00:58:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/lore/</guid><description>World Overview # The World of Firmaterra # The world of Firmaterra is divided by an enigmatic and ‚Äúimpenetrable‚Äù barrier known as the Firmament Divide.
