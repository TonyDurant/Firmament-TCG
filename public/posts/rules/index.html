<a class=anchor href=#turn-phases>#</a></h3><ol><li><strong>Begin Phase:</strong> Deactivate (turn your cards upright) all your permanent cards on the board so that you can use them again this turn unless there is a modifier or an affect preventing from doing so.<ul><li>Draw one card from your deck. Note: a player do not draw a card on turn number one.</li><li>A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Main Phase:</strong><ul><li>You may play a resource card (as mana or strength) from your hand by placing it in the resource zone. Note: all cards are dual purpose, meaning you can play any card for a resource. Resource value you gain is indicated in the bottom-right corner of a card, written upside-down. Turn the card upside-down, indicating you are using it as a resource and place it in the resource zone.</li><li>Tap resource cards to gain the indicated amount of resources if needed.</li><li>Play cards from your hand by paying the required resources. To pay the resource ‘activate’ a resource card, rotating it 90 degrees.</li><li>Summon warriors, place Grimoire Page cards in the Grimoire zone, use Hero’s ability, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Combat Phase:</strong><ul><li>Declare attacks with your Warriors and/or Attack cards. You do not target a specific Warrior or Hero. Your opponent decides on blockers, meaning how to defend and/or block.</li><li>Your opponent can choose to block with their warriors and/or Defense cards</li><li>Calculate damage and apply it to the involved warriors or heroes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>End Phase:</strong><ul><li>End your turn by playing a resource if you have not already, summon warriors if you can.</li><li>All warriors heal</li><li>If you still have resources to spend, you can use your Hero’s abilities or save the resources for your “Defense Phase”</li><li>Pass the turn</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=card-types>Card Types:

<a class=anchor href=#blocking-damage>#</a></h4><p>In the game, defense cards such as a &ldquo;block X damage&rdquo; cards are used to reduce the amount of damage an attacking warrior deals to hero. Warrior cards block incoming attacks, no damage spills over to the hero unless specified by a card ability. Understanding how blocking mechanics work is essential for strategic gameplay.</p><h5 id=blocking-mechanics>Blocking Mechanics:
<a class=anchor href=#blocking-mechanics>#</a></h5><ol><li><strong>Blocking with Insufficient Block Value:</strong><ul><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A 3 power warrior attacks you, and you block with a &ldquo;block 2 damage&rdquo; card.</li><li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The &ldquo;block 2 damage&rdquo; card absorbs 2 points of damage from the attacking warrior.<ul><li><strong>Result:</strong> The remaining 1 point of damage spills over onto the hero.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Example:</strong><ul><li><strong>Attack Power:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Block Power:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Damage to Hero:</strong> 3 (attack) - 2 (block) = 1 damage spills over to the hero.</li><li><strong>Block Value Equal or Higher than Attack:</strong> If the block value is equal to or higher than the attack power, no damage spills over to the hero.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Blocking with Sufficient Block Value:</strong><ul><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A 3 power warrior attacks you, and you block with a &ldquo;block 4 damage&rdquo; card.</li><li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The &ldquo;block 4 damage&rdquo; card absorbs all 3 points of damage from the attacking warrior.<ul><li><strong>Result:</strong> No damage spills over onto the hero.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Example:</strong><ul><li><strong>Attack Power:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Block Power:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Damage to Hero:</strong> 3 (attack) - 4 (block) = 0 damage spills over to the hero.</li><li><strong>Block Value Lower than Attack:</strong> If the block value is lower than the attack power, the difference in damage spills over to the hero.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Blocking with Another Warrior:<ul><li>When a warrior blocks an attacking warrior, the damage does not spill over to the hero unless there is a special condition or modifier written on the card.</li><li><strong>Example:</strong><ul><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A 3 power warrior attacks you, and you block with a 2 power warrior.</li><li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The attacking warrior deals 3 damage to the blocking warrior, resulting in the blocking warrior being destroyed and sent to the discard pile. Cards in the discard pile are placed face up.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The blocking warrior takes 3 damage and, if its health is less than 3, it is destroyed. No damage spills over to the hero unless specified by a card ability.</li><li><strong>Blocking with Warriors:</strong> When blocking with another warrior, damage does not spill over to the hero unless a card specifies otherwise. If the blocking warrior&rsquo;s power is higher than the attacking warrior&rsquo;s power, the attacking warrior is destroyed. If the warriors have equal power, both warriors are mutually destroyed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><h5 id=summary>Summary:
